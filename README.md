SQL Data Analysis Project: Business Case_ Target SQL.pdf

This particular project focuses on the operations of Company X in Brazil and provides insightful information about 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. The dataset offers a comprehensive view of various dimensions 
including the order status, price, payment and freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews. By analysing this extensive dataset, it becomes possible to gain valuable insightsinto 
company's operations in Brazil. The information can shed light on various aspectsof the business, such as order processing, pricing strategies, payment and shipping efficiency, customer demographics, product 
characteristics, and customer satisfaction levels.

Python Project: Zomato.ipynb

The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, 
Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With each day new restaurants opening the industry has’nt been saturated yet and the demand is 
increasing day by day. Inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. 
Most ofthe people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they don’t have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of 
a location. What kind of a food is more popular in a locality etc.
